# React Native

3 small code excerpts:
- todo is (maybe unfinshed?) todo practice app in RN
- AMS is a modified RN app that uses the old version of Apply Magic Sauce API to calculate your personality type from your Facebook likes
- 57h is a small part of a bigger app that worked on, just to show code practices
